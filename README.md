# Curs-O-Meter
This is a project that intends to screen out all the possible "slurs" or "curse-words" a user would use in his/her daily life. I have a text version working, am currently working on the speech version.
I intend to make this app useful in a way to help people to turn more professional and avoid using foul language.
